                The John Hancock Center, now known as 875 North Michigan Avenue, the tower was designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. One of the most famous buildings of the structural expressionist style, the skyscraper's distinctive X-braced exterior shows that the structure's skin is part of its "tubular system". This is one of the engineering techniques which the designers used to achieve a record height; the tubular system is the structure that keeps the building upright during wind and earthquake loads. This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan. The building's tapering form and black anodized aluminum exterior contribute to its sleek and modern aesthetic.      </p>
