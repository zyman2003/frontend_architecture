                Completed in 1930, the building was designed by the architectural firm Graham, Anderson, Probst & White. Designer Alfred Shaw integrated art deco stylings with influences from three building types—the warehouse, the department store and the skyscraper. Its design features a distinctive façade adorned with setbacks, vertical fluting, and decorative friezes that capture the essence of the Art Deco movement.  Ribbon piers define the windows, and the building's chamfered corners, minimal setbacks, and corner pavilions disguise the edges of the mass and visually reduce bulk.

Built by Marshall Field & Co. and later owned for over half a century by the Kennedy family, the Mart centralized Chicago's wholesale goods business by consolidating architectural and interior design vendors and trades under a single roof</p>
