                The Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower, The Willis Tower, originally the Sears Tower, is a 110-story, 1,451-foot (442.3 m) skyscraper  taht stands as an iconic symbol of modern architecture and engineering prowess in Chicago. Completed in 1973, the tower was designed by architect Bruce Graham and structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan of the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The design of the Willis Tower revolutionized skyscraper construction by introducing the innovative bundled tube structural system. The tower consists of nine bundled tubes, each rising independently before converging into a single structure, creating a distinctive appearance. Its sleek, black exterior and bold, minimalist design exemplify the architectural style of the time.
