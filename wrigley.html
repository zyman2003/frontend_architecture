                The building was designed by the architectural firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst & White using the shape of the Giralda tower of Seville's Cathedral combined with French Renaissance details.  The gleaming white terra cotta façade and clock tower give the Wrigley Building a regal appearance.The design pays homage to the Wrigley Company's success and influence in the business world during the early 20th century.               </p>

                Completed in 1924, the building was commissioned by William Wrigley Jr., the prominent chewing gum magnate. The Wrigley Building was strategically positioned at the entrance to Chicago's Magnificent Mile and along the Chicago River, reflecting its role as a symbol of the company's success and influence. The Wrigley Building was sold in 2011 to a group of investors that includes Zeller Realty Group.            </div>
