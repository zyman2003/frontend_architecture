                The Tribune Tower is a 463-foot-tall (141 m), 36-floor
                neo-Gothic skyscraper built for a design competition initiated
                by the Chicago Tribune newspaper. The winning design, submitted
                by architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood, embraced a
                neo-Gothic style, drawing inspiration from European cathedrals
                and incorporating elements such as flying buttresses and spires.
                The tower features carved images of Robin Hood (Hood) and a
                howling dog (Howells) near the main entrance to commemorate the
                architects. The top of the tower is designed after the Tour de
                beurre (″butter tower″) of the Rouen Cathedral in France, which
                is characteristic of the Late-Gothic style, that is to say,
                without a spire but with a crown-shaped top.

                Commissioned by the Chicago Tribune newspaper, the tower's
                history dates back to 1922 when the newspaper announced an
                international design competition for its new headquarters. The
                winning design, created by architects John Mead Howells and
                Raymond Hood, resulted in the construction of the Tribune Tower,
                which was completed in 1925. Since 2018 it has been converted
                into luxury residences and in 2023 won a Driehaus Prize for
                architectural preservation and adaptive reuse from Landmarks
                Illinois.
